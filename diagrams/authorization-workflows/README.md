GPII Authorization Workflow Diagrams
====================================

## GPII Authorization Workflows

These source files of diagrams created to demonstrate GPII authorization workflows for 2 use cases:

* Auth-local flow manager to cloud based flow manager.graffle: Between GPII local flow manager to GPII cloud based flow manager
* Auth-locally integrated web apps.graffle: Locally integrated web applications

The exported PNG format of these source files are used on the wiki page of [GPII Authorization Workflows](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/GPII_Authorization_Workflows).

## One Proposed but Declined Authorization Flow

* Use OAuth2 for native apps.graffle: a proposed authorization workflow using the specification of [OAuth2 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-06).

The exported PNG format of this source file is used on the wiki page of [Protect communication between Local Flow Manager and Cloud Based Flow Manager](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Protect_communication_between_Local_Flow_Manager_and_Cloud_Based_Flow_Manager).

## Protect the Communication between GPII Local App and GPII Cloud

* Auth-how to use client id and secret.graffle: the workflow to request an access token using OAuth2 resource owner grant in GPII.

* Dedicated private machine.graffle: the workflow for public machines to request an access token from GPII cloud using dedicated private computer approach.

* Dedicated process-request access token.graffle: this graffle fiile contains a few diagrams that show the workflow and designs for GPII app to request an access token using dedicated process approach.

* Dedicated process-the start of gpii app.graffle: the workflow to start GPII using dedicated process approach.

* Yubikey OTP.graffle: the workflow to request client secret from GPII cloud with Yubikey OTP (one time password).

The exported PNG format of most of these source files are used on the wiki page of [Continued Researches on Possible Approaches for Protecting Communication btw LFM and CBFM](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Continued_Researches_on_Possible_Approaches_for_Protecting_Communication_btw_LFM_and_CBFM#The_Workflow_of_Using_OAuth2_Client_ID.2FSecret).

The exported PNG format of diagrams from `Dedicated process-request access token.graffle` are used on the wiki page of [Designs of Using a Dedicated Process to Protect the Client Secret Assigned to a Local GPII Application](https://wiki.gpii.net/index.php?title=Designs_of_Using_a_Dedicated_Process_to_Protect_the_Client_Secret_Assigned_to_GPII_Local_Installation).

## Request and Manage OAuth2 client credentials

* OAuthCredential.bmpr: UI workflows of how GPII apps request client credentials from GPII Cloud, as well as how GPII users manage client credentials at a central website.

The exported PNG format of mockups from this file are used on the wiki page of [Workflows to request and manage client credentials](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Workflows_to_Request_and_Manage_Client_Credentials).
