GPII Architecture Diagrams
==========================

This directory contains the SVG source file of the architecure diagram created to illustrate the different components that are part of the core architecture.
This diagram was initially created using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) and has been exported to an SVG format file for easy source sharing.
To update this diagram, you can use __draw.io__ by just importing the SVG file, but you can also import the SVG file into any application of your choice.

This diagram is linked from the wiki page [GPII Architecture Dashboard](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Architecture_Dashboard#Architecture_Diagrams) and is also included in this repository's [payloads section](https://github.com/GPII/gpii-architecture-docs/tree/master/payloads/README.md).
